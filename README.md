This repo is a documentation and log of my progress in learning **Java** gradually. Each folder contains materials and code samples based on a particular topic that I have learned.

## ðŸŽ¯ goals
- Document the process of learning Java in a structured way.
- Become a personal reference when repeating Java material.
- Train the ability to write and understand code gradually.


## ðŸ“Œ note
This repo is still being updated according to the material I learned.
